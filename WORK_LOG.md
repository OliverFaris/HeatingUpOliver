| January 9  |  7:35-8:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                 Initially this problem set brought me great confusion but I think I get it now. Its ok for a run to have a one number gap as long as the next number is greater than the previous (e.g. 12, 11, 13 is 2 because 12 --> 13). Now that I actually understand the problem set I tried brainstorming potential solutions. Right now I cannot think of anything since I feel like there are many edge cases and paths you can go down looking at the examples on the slides. |
| January 12 |  9:00-9:30pm  |                                                                                     Looking at this with fresh eyes kind of reminds me of recursion. Recursion came up for me because it just looks like we go back and forth between temerperatures. For example if we had 71 73 68 82 85 91 87, when we hit the 85, there are two cases where we could go to the 91 or 87 and the temperatures could keep going after that which smells like recursion. How to code this? I don't know but my guess is that for each temp, you recurse to the next and on, while counting the length and stuff. That was incredibly vague but its all I have for now. |
| January 13 | 11:00-11:55am |                                                                                                             Mr. Blicks hint was pretty helpful to think of it in terms of graph theory but it does make me wonder how to solve this without graph theory. Will it be a totally different lens (like how initially graph theory was completely new to me). Anyways, I immediatly thought about DFS when I heard graph theory and I guess we could do it with recursion like last pset. Hearing Lucas and Jack's idea was pretty interesting and I understood most of it but it seems pretty difficult to translate into code with the 2d array and such. |
| January 14 | 10:10-10:45pm | By this point I feel like I didn't really reach a concrete solution that would most likely work and they felt more vague and stuff. So I tried thinking of the brute force, 2^n way. I am thinking that for every number, you keep moving on until you find a number lower. Then once you find a lower number go one more number again and check if its greater or less than. If its still less, then record that length but if its longer keep going. I think this solution could partly work but it doesn't account for the fact that multiple paths can start from one number which is maybe where the recursion I spoke about earlier could fit in. |
